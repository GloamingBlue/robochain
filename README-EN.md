## Introduction

---

Combining the large model (OpenAI-GPT3.5) with the ROS2 (Foxy) 
communication framework, adding prompts and task primitives
The use of (primitives) is convenient for robot developers 
to quickly use large models for development.

---

## Installation

--- 

1. Create a new ros workspace and enter the space
   ```commandline
    mkdir gpt_ws && cd gpt_ws
    ```
2. Clone the repo to the workspace
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/NoneJou072/ROS2-GPT-Interface.git
   ```
3. install related dependencies
    ```
    pip install -r src/requirements.txt
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
   ```
4. build and source the workspace
    ```
   colcon build --symlink-install
   source install/local_setup.sh
   ```
   
## Usage  
---
Start the server and client respectively in two terminals, wait for the client
initialization to complete, We can enter requests or questions in the terminal
and wait for the server to execute or respond.

### 1. Change setting
a. rewrite `gpt_client/gpt_client/config.json` fileï¼Œinstead of your openai-key
   ```
   "OPENAI_API_KEY": "<Your openai-key>"
   ```

### 2. Run the node
```bash
# Terminal 1
ros2 run gpt_server gpt_server
```
```bash
# Terminal 2
ros2 run gpt_client gpt_client
```
<div style="display: flex;">
  <div style="flex: 50%;">
    <img src="docs/assets/client_test.png" alt="Image 1">
  </div>
  <div style="flex: 54%;">
    <img src="docs/assets/server_test.png" alt="Image 2">
  </div>
</div>

### 3. Extra Command

| Command | Description  |
|---------|--------------|
| !exit   | exit process |
| !quit   | exit process |
| !clear  | clear screen |

### 4. Robotic Prompt

Refer to Microsoft's [PromptCraft-Robotics](https://github.com/microsoft/PromptCraft-Robotics),
We have a small number of basic robot prompts built in, stored in `gpt_client/prompts`. According to these prompts,
GPT can recognize our instructions and convert them into executable Python code on the server side for execution. Developers can add their own
The prompt words, so that the robot can perform the corresponding task according to the general description. The task primitive instantiation contained in each task prompt word is stored in
`gpt_server/primitives.py`.

**About the initialization of Prompts:** Usually, in order to make a GPT that meets our needs and successfully generate Python code that can be extracted,
We need to format through the `system` role type during initialization, and then alternately enter the `user` and `assistant` role information. Specifically, you can view `gpt_client/system_prompts/system.txt`.
